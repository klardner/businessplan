The policy is in line with the Parental Leave Acts 1998 to 2006, with the principal
elements set out below. It covers employees of ELHQ Solicitors (the **“Employer”**) provided that they meet the conditions outlined below.

## Purpose
The purpose of parental leave is to provide temporary unpaid leave to employees
who are natural parents, adoptive parents or acting in loco parentis to the child to
take care of their child before they reach 8 years of age.

## Entitlements and conditions

-   Employees who are natural parents, adoptive parents or acting in loco
parentis to a child are entitled to 18 working weeks’ unpaid leave to enable
care of their child.
-   An employee must have one year’s continuous service with the Employer
before he/she is entitled to parental leave. However, an employee with less
than 1 year’s continuous service may be entitled to a pro rata parental leave
entitlement after 3 months’ service, if the child is about to go beyond the
specified age limit. The parental leave entitlement is one weeks’ unpaid leave
for each month of continuous employment.
-   The leave must be taken before the child reaches eight years of age,
except in certain circumstances in the case of an adopted or disabled child.
-   In the case of an adopted child, who is under six years of age at the time of
adoption, the leave must be taken before the child reaches eight years of age.
If the child is aged between six and eight years at the time of adoption, the
leave must be taken within two years of the adoption order.

In the case of a child with a disability or long-term illness, leave may be taken up to
the child reaching 16 years. In addition, where illness or other incapacity prevents the
employee taking care of the child, the employee’s parental leave may be
suspended/postponed until he/she is no longer sick provided that he/she produces
satisfactory evidence of sickness.

-   14 weeks’ unpaid parental leave is available per eligible child. However,
where a parent has more that one eligible child, they may not take more than
14 weeks’ parental leave in any 12-month period, except in the case where
the children concerned are children of a multiple birth.
-   Each parent has a separate entitlement to parental leave from his/her job, but
the leave may not be transferred between the parents, i.e. the mother cannot
take the father’s leave and vice versa. Where both parents work for the
Employer, and with their respective managers’/supervising partners’
agreement, up to 14 weeks of parental leave may be transferred from one
parent to another...
-   The leave may be taken in a block of 18 weeks, or two separate blocks of not
less than six weeks with a minimum of 10 weeks between each block, or by
**agreement** with the Employer broken down into pre-planned time off.
-   Periods of training or probation will be suspended while an employee is on
parental leave and will be completed on their return.

## Requests for parental leave

Requests for parental leave must be given to the Employer, a minimum of 6 weeks
prior to the proposed date of commencement. The request must specify the start
date, duration and manner in which it is proposed the parental leave will be taken. A
copy birth certificate or adoption order for the child must be attached.

## Employer’s decision re parental leave

The Employer may decide to postpone the parental leave for up to 6 months, if
satisfied that granting the leave would have a substantial adverse effect on the
operation of the business, if there are difficulties with finding a replacement or if a
number of employees are already availing of parental leave. The Employer must
discuss the postponement with the employee and must provide an explanation in
writing no later than four weeks before the proposed date of commencement of the
parental leave, specifying the grounds for the postponement.

The Employer must produce a Confirmation Document, confirming details of parental
leave, for the employee to sign at least 4 weeks prior to the date of commencement.
The confirmation document will specify the date of commencement of the leave, its
duration and the manner in which it will be taken.

Both the employee and the Employer will hold signed copies of all Confirmation
Documents.

## Protection of employment rights

All employment, statutory and contractual rights are protected while on parental
leave, with the exception of remuneration and superannuation benefits.

Employees will continue to accrue both annual leave and public holiday entitlements
during parental leave.

An employee will return to his/her normal or usual job on completion of the period of
parental leave.

## Illness during Parental Leave
-   An employee who falls ill while on parental leave and as a result is unable to
care for the child may suspend the parental leave for the duration of the
illness following which period, parental leave recommences. An employee
seeking to postpone or suspend a period of parental leave must notify the
Employer in writing, as soon as is reasonably practicable after becoming
sick, and include with the notice the relevant evidence in respect of the
sickness.

## Abuse of Parental Leave
-   An employee must use his/her parental leave to take care of the child
concerned. The Employer may terminate the leave if it has reasonable
grounds to believe that the leave is being used for a purpose other than
taking care of the child concerned. If following an investigation the employee
is found to have been abusing this leave he/she may be subject to disciplinary
action.
-   Before terminating the parental leave the Employer must notify the employee
in writing of its intention to do so and invite the employee to make
representations on the matter within seven days. The Employer must then
consider the employee's submission before deciding whether to terminate the
leave.
-   If the Employer decides to terminate the leave the employee must be notified
in writing of such termination specifying the grounds and the date of
termination. The date of termination of leave must be no less than seven days
after the notification of termination is given. In a case were the leave is
terminated and the employee returns to work, the period between the date of
the employees returning to work and the date on which the leave would have
ended if the employee had completed the leave does not count as parental
leave.

## Refusal to grant Parental Leave

-   The Employer may by notice in writing refuse to grant parental leave if it has
reasonable grounds to believe the employee is not entitled. The notice shall
contain a statement in summary form of the grounds for refusing to grant the
parental leave concerned.
-   Before refusing the parental leave the Employer must notify the employee in
writing of its intention to do so and invite the employee to make representations on the matter within seven days. The Employer must then
consider the employee's submission before deciding whether to refuse the
leave.
