# Part A -- Introduction, Objectives and Definitions

ELHQ Solicitors is committed to protecting the dignity of all those who
work within the firm. In particular, we are committed to ensuring that
our firm is free from any form of bullying, harassment or sexual
harassment and that our work environment is conducive to providing a
high quality legal service in an atmosphere of respect, safety and
equality. All employees have the right to be treated with dignity and
respect.

No bullying or harassment or sexual harassment within the firm or in
connection with the work of the firm will be tolerated. Complaints of
bullying or harassment may be dealt with either in a formal or an
informal way, or by alternative means, as described below.

Complaints by employees or other persons in the workplace of bullying or
harassment at work will be treated with fairness, sensitivity, respect
and (as far as possible) confidentiality for all parties concerned. Any
person accused of bullying or harassment will be afforded natural
justice and treated with fairness and sensitivity.

Both the firm's management and its employees have responsibilities for
creating and contributing to the maintenance of a work environment free
from bullying and harassment. Employees also have an obligation to
cooperate with the investigation of complaints of bullying or harassment
in the firm. Managers and supervisors have a particular responsibility
to implement this policy and to make every effort to ensure that
bullying and harassment does not occur, particularly in work areas for
which they are responsible. Managers and supervisors have an obligation
to deal promptly and effectively with any incidents of bullying or
harassment of which they are aware or ought to be aware.

Bullying, sexual harassment and harassment by employers, employees and
nonemployees such as clients, customers and business contacts will not
be tolerated and could lead to disciplinary action (in the case of
employees) and other sanctions, for example the suspension of contracts
or services, or exclusions from premises (in the case of non-employees).

## Bullying

Bullying at work is defined as repeated inappropriate behaviour, direct
or indirect, whether verbal, physical or otherwise, conducted by one or
more persons against another or others, at the place of work and/or in
the course of employment, which could reasonably be regarded as
undermining the individual's right to dignity at work.

An isolated incident of the type of behaviour contemplated by this
definition may be an affront to dignity but as a once off incident, it
is not considered to be bullying.

A key characteristic of bullying is that it usually takes place over a
period of time. It is regular and persistent inappropriate behaviour
which is specifically targeted at one employee or a group of employees.
It may be perpetrated by someone in a position of authority, by
employees against a manager or by employees at the same level.

The following is a non-exhaustive list of examples of types of behaviour
that may constitute bullying:

-   Exclusion with negative consequences. Hostility through sustained
unfriendly conduct.
-   Verbal abuse/insult, including shouting, use of obscene language and
spreading malicious rumours.
-   Being treated less favourably than colleagues.
-   Intrusion -- pestering, spying or stalking.
-   Menacing behaviour.
-   Intimidation.
-   Aggression.
-   Undermining behaviour.
-   Excessive monitoring of work.
-   Humiliation.
-   Withholding work-related information.
-   Repeatedly manipulating a person's job content and targets.
-   Applying blame for things beyond the person's control.
-   Constant humiliation, ridicule, belittling efforts.
-   Inappropriate overruling of a person's authority, reducing a job to
routine taskswell below the person's skills and capabilities without prior discussion
or explanation.
-    Use of social media to undermine or exclude colleagues.


## Harassment

Harassment is any form of unwanted conduct related to any of the following grounds:

-   gender
-   civil status
-   family status
-   sexual orientation
-   religious belief (or lack thereof)
-   age
-   disability
-   race, colour, nationality or ethnic or national origin
-   membership of the Traveller community which has the purpose or effect of violating a person’s dignity and/or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for the person. 

Harassment may be targeted at one employee or a group of employees. Harassment may consist of a single incident or repeated inappropriate behaviour. An act of
harassment may occur outside the work premises or normal working hours provided the
perpetrator was acting in the course of employment, for example, at a training course,
conference or work-related social event. Harassment includes situations where the
victim does not have the relevant characteristic but the harasser believes that the victim
has that characteristic.

Many forms of behaviour, including spoken words, gestures or the display/circulation of
words, pictures or other material, may constitute harassment. The following is a nonexhaustive list of examples of types of behaviour that constitute harassment:

-   Verbal harassment – jokes, comments, ridicule or songs
-   Written harassment – including faxes, text messages, emails or notices
-   Physical harassment – jostling, shoving or any form of assault
-   Intimidatory harassment – gestures, posturing or threatening poses
-   Visual displays such as posters, emblems or badges
-   Excessive monitoring of work
-   Isolation or exclusion from social activities
-   Unreasonably changing a person’s job content or targets
-   Pressure to behave in a manner that the employee thinks is inappropriate, for
example being required to dress in a manner unsuited to a person’s ethnic or
religious background.
-   Harassment through social media

Unlike with bullying, a single incident may constitute harassment.

## Sexual harassment

Sexual harassment is any form of unwanted verbal, non-verbal or physical conduct of a
sexual nature which has the purpose or effect of violating a person’s dignity and/or
creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for the
person.

Many forms of behaviour can constitute sexual harassment. It includes examples like
those contained in the following list:

-   Physical conduct of a sexual nature — This may include unwanted physical
contact such as unnecessary touching, patting or pinching or brushing against
another employee’s body, assault and coercive sexual intercourse.
-   Verbal conduct of a sexual nature — This includes unwelcome sexual advances,
propositions or pressure for sexual activity, continued suggestions for social
activity outside the work place after it has been made clear that such suggestions
are unwelcome, unwanted or offensive flirtations, suggestive remarks, innuendos
or lewd comments.
-   Non-verbal conduct of a sexual nature — This may include the display of
pornographic or sexually suggestive pictures, objects, written materials, emails,
text-messages or faxes. It may also include leering, whistling or making sexually
suggestive gestures.
-   Gender-based conduct — This includes conduct that denigrates or ridicules or is
intimidatory or physically abusive of an employee because of his or her sex such 
as derogatory or degrading abuse or insults which are gender-related.

This list is illustrative rather than exhaustive. A single incident may constitute sexual
harassment.

In this policy, the expression “bullying and/or harassment” should be read as including
“bullying, harassment and/or sexual harassment”.

### Intention irrelevant

The intention of the perpetrator of the sexual harassment or harassment is irrelevant.
The fact that the perpetrator has no intention of sexually harassing or harassing the
employee is no defence. The effect of the behaviour on the employee is what is relevant.
It is up to the employee to decide what behaviour is unwelcome irrespective of the
attitude of others to the matter

### Reasonable discipline and management is not bullying or harassment

The reasonable and essential discipline arising from the good management of the
performance of an employee at work does not amount to bullying or harassment. For
example, an employee whose performance is continuously signaled at a level below
required targets may feel threatened and insecure in their work but this in itself does not
indicate bullying or harassment. Fair and constructive criticism of an employee’s
performance, conduct or attendance does not constitute bullying.

Similarly, actions taken which can be justified as regards the safety, health and welfare
of employees do not amount to bullying or harassment.

### Bullying and/or harassment can exist in many situations

Provisions in this policy which refer to an “employee” shall also apply, where the context
requires, to any person working within the firm, including partners, solicitors, legal executives, support staff, trainee solicitors and temporary agency staff. 

Bullying/harassment by nonemployees may result in the termination/non-renewal of business contracts, the
suspension/non-renewal of services, exclusion from the premises or the imposition of
other appropriate sanctions.

Bullying and/or harassment at work can involve people in many different work situations
and at all levels:

-   partner/manager/supervisor to employee;
-   employee to partner/supervisor/manager;
-   one employee to another (or group to group);
-   customer or business contact to employee;
-   employee/supervisor/manager/partner to customer/business contact.

All such situations are encompassed by this policy. This policy extends to behaviour
which occurs outside the firm’s premises, such as at social functions or training events,
provided there is a sufficient link with the work of the firm and its employees.


### Preservation of rights and prevention of victimisation

Making a complaint under this policy will not affect an employee’s statutory rights. No
one will be victimised for making a complaint in good faith or for acting in good faith as a
witness in an investigation.

Nothing in this policy limits the right of the firm to investigate any matter which may
relate to bullying and/or harassment in circumstances other than where a complaint has
been made. All employees continue to have an obligation to cooperate with any such
investigation.

### Designated contact person

Kieran Lardner has been designated as the contact person in respect of this
policy. In the event that any employee has any question or query about the operation of
this policy or requires any clarification about it, they may approach the designated
contact person for advice, which will be given in strictest confidence. Please note that
speaking to the designated contact person is not the same as making a formal or
informal complaint.

### Allocation of Responsibilities

Management and others in positions of authority have a particular responsibility to
ensure that sexual harassment and harassment does not occur and that complaints are
addressed speedily. In particular, management will:

-   provide good example by treating all in the workplace with courtesy and respect
-   promote awareness of the organisation’s policy and complaints procedures
-   be vigilant for signs of harassment and take action before a problem escalates
-   respond sensitively to an employee who makes a complaint of harassment
-   explain the procedures to be followed if a complaint of sexual harassment or
harassment is made
-   ensure that an alleged perpetrator is treated fairly
-   ensure that an employee making a complaint is not victimised for doing so
-   monitor and follow up the situation after a complaint is made so that sexual
harassment or harassment does not recur.

This policy will be communicated effectively to all those potentially affected by it.
Incidents of sexual harassment and harassment will be monitored and training provided.
The policy will be reviewed on a regular basis in line with changes in the law, relevant caselaw or other developments. 

### Statutory Redress

This policy is designed to support employees in the resolution of complaints of
bullying/harassment. However, it does not prevent employees from exercising statutory
entitlements under the Industrial Relations Acts, 1946 to 2015 or the Employment
Equality Acts 1998 to 2015. Complaints under the Employment Equality Act must
normally be brought within 6 months of the most recent act of discrimination.

# Part B - Dealing with Bullying and Harrassment

1. LAWCARE
The Law Society has arranged with an independent organisation, LawCare, to
provide a 365 day a year confidential helpline service for lawyers, their families
and their staff. LawCare is a charitable organisation which offers support and
assistance in a wide range of circumstances, including those where people feel
they are suffering stress and/or distress as a result of bullying or harassment in
the workplace.

LawCare’s helpline number is 1800 991801 (Monday to Friday 9 am to 7.30 pm;
weekends / Public Holidays 10 am to 4 pm). For further information about the
range of situations in which LawCare offers support, please refer to
www.lawcare.ie.

**Very important**: Speaking to LawCare is not the same as making a formal or
informal complaint. LawCare provides support and assistance, but employees
may still need to make a formal or informal complaint in order to resolve the
problem in the context of which bullying or harassment may have occurred.
Formal and informal complaints should be made by employees in the manner
prescribed in this policy

2. **THE INFORMAL COMPLAINT PROCESS**

## Method of making an informal complaint

Any employee who believes he or she is being bullied should, where possible,
indicate directly to the person complained of that the behaviour in question is
unacceptable.

If the employee believes that approach is not suitable or has been unsuccessful,
the employee may then make an informal complaint.

Informal complaints should be addressed to Kieran Lardner, the Partner responsible for Compliance with the Firms' policies. 

It is preferable that an informal complaint is made in writing but it may also be
verbal.

The firm will designate a person to handle the complaint. If the complaint was
verbal, a written note of what is complained of will be taken by the designated
person and a copy given to the complainant.

## Procedure which will be followed

The designated person will establish the facts, the context and then the next
course of action in dealing with the matter under the informal procedure.

(a) *Where specific examples are given*

If the complaint concerns bullying and/or harassment and includes
specific examples of the behaviour complained of, the person complained
against will be presented with the complaint and given a chance to
respond.

After the response is received (or a reasonable period has elapsed
without a response having been received) a method will be agreed to progress the issue to resolution so that both parties can return to a
harmonious working environment without bullying or harassment being a
factor.

If the behaviour complained of does not concern bullying or harassment
as defined, an alternative approach will be put in place and a rationale
recorded.

(b) *Where no specific examples are given*

If no specific examples are provided, there is no complaint to be
answered under this policy, though other means of protecting and
repairing work-place relationships may be considered by the designated
person.

In either case, line managers will be kept informed, as appropriate, about the
process in train.

The designated person will keep a record of all stages: the complaint, the first
meeting, action agreed and signed records of the final meeting. The purpose of
the records, which will not include detail of discussions, is to provide evidence
that the complaint was dealt with in an appropriate manner.
All parties will maintain, insofar as possible, the confidentiality of the informal
process. Breaches of confidentiality will be treated as a serious disciplinary
matter.



## Resolution

When resolution is found through informal procedures, both parties will be given
support or periodical reviews, as appropriate. These may include counseling or
other appropriate interventions.
Where a complaint is not upheld and is found not to have been made in good
faith, the complainant will be subject to disciplinary action.

4. **THE FORMAL COMPLAINT PROCEDURE**

In cases where an employee believes an informal complaint is not a suitable
means of addressing his or her concern, or where the employee believes that
their previous recourse to the informal complaint procedure has been
unsatisfactory, the employee may make a formal complaint of bullying and/or
harassment.

In cases where an employee makes an informal complaint but where the firm’s
management believes (because of the gravity of the subject matter of the
complaint or for some other reason) that the informal complaint procedure is
inadequate to address the compliant, that complaint may, with the consent of the
employee, be dealt with using the formal complaint procedure.

## Method of making a formal complaint

Formal complaints should be made in writing and signed and dated. The
complaint should be confined to precise details of alleged incidents of bullying or
harassment, including the dates of such incidents and the names of any
witnesses.

Formal complaints should be addressed to Kieran Lardner.

On receipt of a formal complaint, an investigator will be designated by the firm’s
management. In exceptional circumstances, if either party has an objection to the
designated investigator, the firm’s management may designate an alternative
investigator. An objection to the designated investigator must be made in writing
to the firm’s management and must clearly outline the grounds of the objection.

## Complaints in writing

Where a formal complaint is made but the complainant declines to submit a
written statement, then a written record will be made of the complaint by the
designated investigator. The complainant will be asked to sign this record.

In the event that the complainant refuses to sign this record, the complainant will
be made aware that the ability of the firm to investigate the complaint on a formal
basis may be compromised by any failure by the complainant to cooperate with
the firm’s procedures. Efforts will be made to clarify this issue before any further
steps are taken.

The complainant will be advised of the aims and objectives of the formal process,
the procedures and time-frame involved, and the possible outcomes. He or she
will be assured of support as required throughout the process. He or she will be
given a copy of this policy.

## Procedure which will be followed

The investigation will be governed by terms of reference which will include the
following provisions:

-   a provision to the effect that the investigation will be conducted in
accordance with this policy;
-   an indicative time-frame for the completion of the investigation;
-   provisions relating to the scope of the investigation, indicating that the
investigator will consider whether the complaint falls within the definition
of bullying or harassment at work and whether the complaint has been
upheld.

The person complained against will be notified in writing that an allegation of
bullying or harassment has been made against him or her. He or she will be
advised of the aims and objectives of the formal process and procedures and
time frame involved and the possible outcomes. He or she will be assured of
support as required throughout the process. A meeting will be organised at which
he or she is given a copy of the complaint in full and any relevant documents
including this policy.

The investigator will meet with the complainant and the person complained
against and any witnesses or relevant persons with a view to establishing the
facts. The complainant and the person complained against will both be entitled to
be accompanied by an appropriate representative. This may be by a Firm
colleague of their choice (or a legal representative from outside the Firm)

All interviews with parties and witnesses will be conducted sensitively and with
due respect to the rights of all concerned. The investigation will be conducted on
a confidential basis, insofar as that is possible.

Statements from all parties and witnesses will be reduced to writing. Copies of
the record of their statements will be given to and agreed with those who make
statements to the investigator.

## During the investigation

All parties will continue to work normally during the investigation unless directed
otherwise. The firm’s management will make every effort to ensure the protection
of all involved in the investigation.

The parties to the complaint should not communicate regarding the complaint. 

Any effort by any employee to intimidate or otherwise influence any complainant
or witness during the course of an investigation will be regarded as a disciplinary
matter.

## Conclusion of investigation

The objective of an investigation will be to ascertain whether or not, on the
balance of probabilities:

(a) the behaviour complained of occurred and, if so,
(b) whether or not that behaviour amounted to bullying and/or harassment as
defined.

It will be open to the designated investigator to determine that behaviour
occurred which did not amount to bullying or harassment but which was
inappropriate in some other way. In that event, separate disciplinary action may
follow.

The investigation will be completed as quickly as practicable, preferably within
the indicated time-frame. The investigator will submit a report to the firm’s
management, which report will include conclusions. The complainant and the
person complained against will be given a copy of the report as soon as
practicable by the firm’s management and given an opportunity to comment,
within a prescribed period of time, before the firm’s management decides on any
further course of action.

The firm’s management will decide the action which is to be taken arising from
the report in light of the investigator’s report and any comments made by the
parties. The firm’s management will then, in writing, inform the complainant and
the person complained against of the next steps which are to occur.

## Action where the complaint is upheld

If a complaint is upheld, the matter will be treated as a serious disciplinary issue
and the firm will follow the appropriate disciplinary procedures. If the perpetrator
is not an employee (for example, if he or she is a client) other appropriate
measures will be taken.

The firm may also take other appropriate action to support and protect the victim
and or to ensure that similar situations do not arise in future.

## Action where complaint is not upheld

If the complaint is not upheld but the complainant is found to have acted in good
faith, the firm may take appropriate measures to support both the complainant
and the person complained against. This will include the making of appropriate
efforts to ensure that anyone with knowledge of the complaint is made aware of
the finding that it was not upheld.

Where a complaint is not upheld and is found not to have been made in good faith, the complainant will be the subject of disciplinary action.

## Appeals

If either party is dissatisfied with the outcome of the formal complaints procedure,
they may lodge an appeal within 7 days of receipt of notification of the outcome
of the process.

The reasons for the appeal should be outlined in writing to the firm’s
management. The appeal will be heard by another person, of at least the same
level of seniority as the original investigator. The appeal will focus only on the
aspect of the case cited by the appellant as being the subject of the appeal.

The grounds of the appeal and any outcome and methodology employed will be
appended to the investigation file.

## Resolution
Both parties will be given appropriate support and periodical reviews, insofar as
is reasonable, after the formal process has been concluded.

5. **EXTERNAL INVESTIGATION**

In any situation where, by reason of the size of the firm, seniority of a
complainant or a person complained against, or for any other reason, it is not
appropriate for a formal complaint, informal complaint or appeal to be
investigated by an employee of the firm, then the firm reserves the right to
appoint an appropriate external person to carry out the investigation. Any such
external person will carry out his or her functions in accordance with the
provisions of this policy and the firm will give appropriate effect to the findings of
such an external person.

This policy is valid from 1 May 2021. It may be amended from time to time at the
discretion of the firm's management.
