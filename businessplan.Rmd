# Management Plan

## General Management

The Partners are equal partners with equal voting rights.
In keeping with ELHQ Solicitors' image as a market leading firm, the Partners have appointed Eddie Hynes as managing partner.
However, a management committee will be formed and any significant decisions will be taken by the Partners collectively.

The Partners will have monthly meetings where they will report any issues or concerns, discuss ELHQ Solicitors' progress and take any decisions as necessary.

The Partners considered the alternative structure of an LLP, but decided that a traditional partnership was the best option for ELHQ Solicitors' at this time given the legal certainty that the established structure offers.

## Partnership Agreement

While there is no requirement that partnership arrangements must be in writing, the Partners have agreed that certain provisions of the Partnership Act, 1890 (the "**1890 Act**") are not appropriate for the modern management structure that is envisaged by ELHQ Solicitors.

As a result, the Partners have agreed to enter into a formal written partnership agreement (the "**Partnership Agreement**") in order to override certain default provisions in the 1890 Act.

In particular, the Partnership Agreement will address the financial rights of the partners, remuneration, partnership property and dissolution of partnership. 

The Partners will draft the Partnership Agreement in an effort to reduce costs.
An outline of the clauses which will be included in the Partnership Agreement is attached at Appendix 1

### The Location

ELHQ Solicitors has decided to lease an office space in Dublin 2 for a variety of reasons.
As previously discussed, situating the office in the heart of Dublin City will provide the most convenient access to aspiring startup businesses as well as international clients who are looking to establish themselves in Dublin.
An office space in Dublin City Centre will also provide the Firm with access to the Four Courts and is well-connected to public transport which will allow for ease of access for staff and clients alike.
Dublin 2 is perfectly situated in terms of business support services, such as accounting firms and auditors.

ELHQ Solicitors has decided to lease a sixth floor office at Watkins House, Hight Street, Dublin 2..
Conor Quane, Partner, contacted the commercial leasing department at GSP Lettings in search of a suitable office space.
GSP Lettings provided a verbal quotation for an office on the sixth floor of Watkins House for an annual fee of €21,600 (exclusive of utility bills), resulting in a monthly expense of €1,800.
Despite the requisite amount being slightly above the Partner's anticipated budget for office letting, it was agreed to lease this office space as there were multiple advantages of doing so.

[ ELHQ Solicitors has agreed to lease the office for an initial period of 18 months with an option to extend for a further 18 months thereafter.

### The Space

The office space itself is spacious and comes fully serviced and furnished.
It has a floor area of over 1,642 square feet and comprises 2 offices, a boardroom, a private meeting room, toilet facilities and a reception area.
There is also a kitchenette which includes a fridge, dishwasher and tea/coffee making facilities.
On the ground floor of Watkins House, there is another reception area that is shared with the other offices in the building.

### Equipment

The office is fully equipped with desks, chairs, furniture and filing space.
Conor Quane has been designated as the Partner responsible for office management.
ELHQ has opened an account with Premier Stationery, an office supplies company, who will supply the Firm with all its required stationery and office equipment.
Premier Stationery have also been contracted to provide and install six telephone units across the office space.

As regards the space itself, there are two offices which comfortably seat two people each.
Each office has two adjustable desks, two swivel chairs and four filing cabinets.
These filing cabinets are highly secure and ideally suitable for the storage of Deeds, security and title documents and other highly classified documents.

In the Boardroom there is a large table with eight chairs and the room has floor to ceiling windows for maximum natural light exposure.
The private meeting room has a round table ideal for client consultations and a large rectangular window which looks out over St Stephen's Green.

The Partners also will purchase stackable chairs for in-house CPD lectures and other social in-office events.

## Technology Requirements {.tabset}

### Software and Hardware

The office at Watkins House, High Street, Dublin 2 is fully connected to high-speed broadband and telephone lines and so there is no expense involved for ELHQ in this regard.
ELHQ has engaged with Safe Wire Limited who will be responsible for all of the Firm's IT requirements.
ELHQ intend on signing a Services Agreement with Safe Wire Limited in respect of the Firm's entire IT infrastructure.
Safe Wire Limited have agreed to provide all the required services required by ELHQ including network security, required software, product-system integration and general IT support and maintenance.
This will cost ELHQ an estimated [€XXXXX] per annum.

Covid-19 has highlighted the necessity to work from home efficiently and flexibly.
With this in mind, the Partners will each receive a laptop that will allow the Partners to work remotely and, when needed, from home so that ELHQ will always be best placed to properly serve our clients regardless of any unforeseen circumstances.
The Firm has decided to purchase four Dell laptops at a price of €XXX each (€XXX overall).
The Firm has also decided to purchase four desktop computer units for the use of future support staff at a cost of €XXX each (€xxx overall).
As part of its Service Agreement, Safe Wire Limited will be responsible for setting up and maintaining these computers.

### Case Management System

[Firm] ELHQ Solicitors has decided to use Legal Partner as its case management software.
Safe Wire Limited has previously worked with several law firms who also used Legal Partner and therefore Safe Wire are well versed in this particular case management system.
The Partners in ELHQ, having explored several options for a case management system opted for Legal Partner as it is ideally suited for commercial law firms in its makeup and it also provides a three month trial version of the software, which will save the firm [€XXX] in Year 1.
Therefore, in the first year ELHQ will pay €XXX for the use of Legal Partner and €XXX per annum thereafter.

## Client Management System {.tabset}

The firm has developed an application in house to help keep track of key information about each of it's client's.
We believe this will improve productivity across the firm and ultimately deliver a more cost-efficient and effective service to our clients.
This includes information such as:

### Key info about the client

> Key information about that employees may regularly need to input on forms or access

<img src="keycontacts.png" alt="Key Info"/>

### Group Structure Charts

> Easy access to group structure charts designed by our Legal Tech team will help our Corporate Team as they seek to advise on complex restructurings etc. (rephrase)

<img src="structure.png" alt="Group Structure Charts"/>

### Information to aid drafting

> This can then be easily downloaded, coverted to a pdf or copied, so that the employee can quickly update their documents.

<img src="table.png" alt="Drafting info"/>

### Statistics

> Our legal tech team has written code to automate the process of producing visualizations and summary statistics across a number of key metrics.

The Compliance Manager will provide each Partner with the practising certificate renewal form in advance of the submission deadline of 1 February each year.
It will be each Partner's responsibility to ensure that the forms are correctly completed on time.

These checklists will be thorough and will be regularly reviewed to ensure that any new regulatory requirements are included.

## Undertakings

The Partners are cognDublinisant of the gravity of non-compliance with undertakings and therefore are implementing a strict process to ensure undertakings are only given when appropriate and necessary.
In line with the collective decision-making, unanimous approval of the Partners must be obtained before an undertaking is given.

## Continuing Professional Development

Regulation 4 of the Solicitors (Continuing Professional Development) Regulations 2017 (the "CPD Regulations") imposes an obligation on all solicitors holding practising certificates to undertake continuing professional development ("CPD").
CPD is defined under the CPD Regulations as education or training to be undertaken by a solicitor relating to law, management and professional development skills or regulatory matters.
The Law Society has published its CPD Scheme for 2020, which sets out the CPD requirements that apply to each solicitor, a copy of which is included at Appendix 5.

Each Partner will be required to undertake 20 hours of CPD per annum, which includes a minimum of 2 hours of regulatory matters and 3 hours of management and professional development skills.
As the Partners have all been qualified for three years, they are unable to avail of the exemption available to newly qualified solicitors.
The ways that a solicitor may complete their CPD requirements are via group study, eLearning and writing relevant material, such as writing for a legal journal or periodical.

The Partners plan to attend CPD events hosted by the Law Society and other professional bodies.
This will satisfy the Partners' CPD requirements and will also give the Partners the opportunity to network with other solicitors and any other interested attendees.
[Firm] also proposes to host a series of one-hour lectures setting out any relevant legal, regulatory and professional developments.
[Firm] will invite solicitors and other interested professionals to attend these lectures, which will be available both in-person and via remote access, such as video conferencing.

[Firm] will also host monthly internal group study sessions between the Partners.
This method of completing CPD is available to [Firm] as there will be more than three people in attendance at each session.
The Partners have also committed to each writing one article or legal review which will be submitted to interested relevant publications such as the Law Society Gazette or The Parchment.

[Firm] has included the cost of satisfying its CPD requirements in its general training budget as set out in paragraph 8.4.

## [Vendor Firm' Files]

The Partners at [Firm] have decided [to / not to] purchase the files of Rhyme & Partners.

[Rationale for decision]

A detailed review of each of the files is set out in Appendix 6.

# Finances

## Overview

Following extensive consultations with accountants and financial advisers specialising in the legal industry, the Partners have agreed on the following financial projections for the first 24 months of trading. Year 1 will run from 1 February 2021 to 31 January 2022, and Year 2 will run from 1 February 2022 to 31 January 2023. 

In light of the ongoing global economic volatility caused by COVID-19 pandemic, and considering the many uncertainties in establishing a new business, the Partners have prepared the financial projections on a conservative basis. The Partners are collectively committed to keeping expenditure to minimum for the first two years of trading, and until profit levels have stabilised. The Partners have agreed also to hold a monthly meeting to assess the financial performance of the firm and address any emerging issues. 

In line with current trends for corporate law firms, clients will generally be billed on a monthly basis, except where agreed otherwise. This should help to regularize income for the Firm during the first few years of its existence.

Full cash flow projections are set out in Appendix 5, and the main items are discussed below. 

## Incomings

### Funding

The Firm’s initial funding will be comprised of capital contributions from the Partners supplemented with external financing. The Partners chose Big Bank plc as Firm’s proposed bank due to its competitive lending rates and wide range of supports for start-ups and SMEs. 

### Capital Contributions 

The Partners have agreed to contribute €30,000 each to the Firm, amounting to €120,000 in total. Each Partner will take a 25% stake in the firm. The contributions will be funded entirely from the personal savings of each Partner.

### Debt

#### Business Start-Up Package

The Partners decided to avail of the [Bank Package] (the "**Package**").
The key features of the Package include free current account maintenance and transactions fees for the first two years and a Business Debit Card for [Firm].
This current account will be used to pay the employees.

#### Loan

Following an examination of the projected cash outflows, it was evident that [Firm] would require additional funding to supplement the capital contribution.
The Partners considered the level of debt that [Firm] should undertake given the economic uncertainty at this time.
The Partners decided that taking out a smaller loan would ensure that [Firm] would be able to meet each loan repayment.

In light of those considerations, the branch manager in [Bank] offered [Firm] a loan of €50,000 which the Partners are prepared to accept.
This loan meets the threshold to qualify for fixed rates instead of a variable rates which offers greater certainty for the financial projections:

-   A €50,000 loan with a fixed interest rate of 6.95% APR repayable in monthly instalments of €988.00 over 5 years; and

-   The term of the loan will begin on 1 January 2021.
    Payments will occur on the 15th day of each month, with the final repayment occurring on 15 December 2025.

#### Overdraft Facility

[Firm] have also secured an overdraft facility of €25,000 with a variable interest rate of 7.85%.
This interest rate means the total cost of credit for [Firm] for an overdraft of €25,000 would be €2,034.60. 

The Partners are aware that the costs associated with this facility are expensive and do not intend to use it for the day-to-day running.
However, the Partners agreed that this facility offers extra support and flexibility in relation to cash shortfalls.

### Fee Incomings

It is anticipated that [Firm] will receive a total fee income of €476,666.66 in Year 1 (10 billable hours x 5 partners x 52 weeks x €200 = €520,000 minus the first month of no fees = €476,666.66).

The clients will be charged on an hourly basis at a rate of €200 an hour.
This is a competitive rate taking into account the relevant levels of experience of the Partners and research conducted on fee structures of similar law firms.

It is agreed that in Year 1 each Partner will aim to bill 10 hours a week.
The Partners believe that this is achievable and expect to surpass that target with the clients that they are bringing into [Firm].
The Partners anticipate that they will bring in new clients into [Firm] toward the end of Year 1 when a resurgence in economic activity is expected.

[Firm] anticipates further growth in the amount of fee income from the period of 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022 once [Firm]'s brand has developed.

# Marketing

## Overview

Our goal is to establish ELHQ Solicitors as a dynamic, and innovative law firm that provides an expert legal service for our clients.

At ELHQ Solicitors, we want to market ourselves as a firm that is capable of adapting quickly to the ever changing legal landscape -- this is in particular focus given the impact of COVID -- 19 on both the legal industry and the wider global economy.

The Partners have adapted to work life during the COVID-19 crisis, and recognize the importance of facilitating the ability to work remotely.
Further, the Partners at ELHQ Solicitors have seen opportunities that can be maximised through flexibility, innovation and adaptability.

## Target Market

ELHQ Solicitors' target market is public & private corporations as well as various commercial bodies.
The Partners are placing a particular emphasis on targeting SMEs and start up companies in order to break into the market before expanding the business to target larger corporations.
Given the current period of economic recovery following the COVID-19 crisis, the Partners believe that this broad focus allows for flexibility and growth in uncertain times.

## Marketing Plan

ELHQ Solicitors has considered how it will employ it's various marketing techniques below, and has conducted a SWOT analysis, a copy of which is provided at Appendix [insert]

### Product

ELHQ Solicitors will adhere to provide a legal service of the highest standard for all of our clients.
We intend on working for and with like minded clients who approach business in a practical, pragmatic and commercial fashion.
Our primary areas of expertise include, but are not limited to, Commercial Litigation and Dispute Resolution, Mergers and Acquisitions, Finance, Intellectual Property and Commercial Property.

### Branding/Logo

The Partners have chosen the name ELHQ Solicitors which represents the surnames of each of the four Partners.
It was felt that the name is distinct and memorable and that the name is suggestive of professionalism and teamwork.
Insofar as each Partner is a valued asset to the business, the name ELHQ Solicitors inherently reflects this.

ELHQ Solicitors will also instruct Logo Design Co to create a logo that will be memorable and reflective of the Firm's values.
The logo will be displayed widely on all of the Firm's social media platforms and website as well as on all stationery (including business cards), publications, and correspondence.

### Office Location

The office of ELHQ Solicitors will be located at Watkins House, High Street, Dublin 2.
After careful consideration the Partners chose this location for three primary reasons.

Firstly, the Partners felt that by situating the office in Dublin City centre, the Firm would be best placed to serve our commercial and corporate clients given that Dublin is something of a hub for ambitious, growing businesses from a national and international standpoint.

Secondly, the standard of living in Dublin is slightly higher than in other parts of the country and the city as a whole is vibrant and energetic.
This factor combined with the access to several highly respected Third Level Institutions near the city centre will ensure that the office will be well placed to attract and retain the highest quality of legal talent in order to aid the continued growth and success of the Firm.

Thirdly, all four Partners have worked in Dublin in a legal capacity for an extended period and each Partner has established important business relationships with potential future clients through this previously completed work.
It will be important for these business relationships to be maintained and improved upon so that ELHQ Solicitors will be successful.

### Price

As ELHQ Solicitors is a newly established firm we intend to be highly competitive in respect of the fees that we charge.However, of utmost importance to the Partners is to provide an exceptional service and in this regard to provide value for money.
As a firm, ELHQ will be responsive and provide practical, commercial assistance in order to reach the heart of any particular legal issue or query quickly.

The Partners commit to producing at least two articles per month which will be shared across all social media platforms.There will also be an option to subscribe for updates, with monthly newsletters and updates sent out to those who register.

##### Social Media

ELHQ Solicitors will have a strong presence across all social media platforms, including LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter,  which will be used to build the brand and to share relevant content.
The Partners have their own LinkedIn accounts which will be used both to make useful connections and to create a strong online presence for the Firm.

ELHQ Solicitors will host a monthly podcast discussing relevant topical legal and commercial issues.
Guest speakers will be invited, which can include clients and experts in the particular area, to provide a more practical discussion on implications of relevant legal updates to the legal and commercial industry.

Eddie Hynes, Managing Partner, has a contact who has agreed to set up the website and podcast hosting platforms for [€XXX].

#### Advertising

Through social media platforms and the Firm's website the intention is to levy as much free advertising online insofar as is possible but this will be supplemented with various other means of advertising.
The advertisements for ELHQ Solicitors will adhere strictly to the Solicitors (Advertising) Regulations 2002 and will include the contact details, areas of expertise and logo of the firm.
It is envisioned that such advertisements will be placed in the Law Society Gazette, the Sunday Business Post and the business supplement of the Irish Times.
As a large part of the target audience for the Firm are start-up companies and SMEs, the Firm will also make contact with organisations such as "NewCo Ireland" to potentially provide sponsorship at conventions and seminars.

#### Sponsorship and Corproate Social Responsibility

ELHQ is keen to integrate in the community in Dublin City centre and to increase local awareness of its business.
The Partners are passionate about the Firm's CSR and hope to develop the Firm's reputation as one which gives back to the community that it is based.
The Partners have agreed to participate in a variety of charitable events in this respect including:

--- Entering a soccer team in the annual five-a-side tournament in Blackhall Place to raise funds for "The Irish Youth Foundation" in support of disadvantaged youths in Ireland.

-   Each Partner to participate in the annual "Calcutta Run", the annual legal fundraiser and to raise funds accordingly.

Clients and contacts will be invited, and at each CPD meeting, lunch and sandwiches will be provided.
These will usually be by way of either a Partner or an expert guest speaker delivering the lecture,with an emphasis on practical and commercial solutions.
The Partners will also lecture in Law Society PPC and Diploma courses in their area of expertise.

#### Initial Launch Night

To boost awareness around the establishment of ELHQ Solicitors a launch night will be arranged within two months of the Firm opening its doors.
It is envisaged that Mount Ivy Hotel near the Firm's office will be booked whereby a canapés and drinks reception will be held.
This of course will be pending the easing of Covid-19 restrictions.
All existing clients of the Partners, any potential clients of the Firm, local businesses and companies will be invited to attend, along with faculty heads from several nearby Third Level Institutions.
The event will be promoted primarily through the Firm's social media platforms and website.
