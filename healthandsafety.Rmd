## Health and Safety at ELHQ

It is the intention of ELHQ Solicitors (the **“Firm”**) to safeguard the health, safety and
welfare of all its employees by all reasonable and practical means. The Firm and its
employees must comply with the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Acts 2005 to
2014, (the “Acts”). These Acts apply to all employers, employees (including fixedterm and temporary employees) and self-employed people in their workplaces. 

The
Firm and its employees must also endeavour to conduct its operations in such a way
as to ensure that members of the public or other individuals at our place of work (who
are not employees of the Firm) are not exposed to unnecessary risks.

It is the Firm’s policy to exercise vigilance, to detect and, where possible, remove
hazards from the workplace, to provide training and instruction to ensure employees
perform their work in a safe and proper manner, and to provide safety equipment and
clothing where necessary.

The Firm will promote standards of safety, health and welfare that comply with the
provisions and requirements of the Acts and other relevant legislation, standards,
and codes of practice. The Firm will, insofar as is reasonably practicable, periodically
review the system in place for the management of occupational safety and health
and where necessary improve it. The Firm will also consult with staff on matters
related to safety, health and welfare at work.

In order to prevent workplace injuries and ill health the Firm is required, among other
things, to:
-   Provide and maintain a safe workplace that is well designed and maintained,
and which uses safe plant, machinery and equipment which is well designed
and maintained
-   Provide a safe means of access to and egress from the place of work
-   Provide safe systems of work
-   Provide welfare facilities and arrangements that are well designed and
maintained
-   Prevent risks from use of any article or substance and from exposure to
physical agents, noise and vibration
-   Prevent any improper conduct or behaviour likely to put the safety, health and
welfare of employees at risk
-   Provide instruction and training to employees on health and safety
-   Provide suitable and maintained protective clothing and equipment
-   Ensure that Emergency Plans are tested and revised regularly

Kieran Lardner, Health and Safety officer, has overall responsibility for health and safety at the
Firm. Day to day management of health and safety is the responsibility of the Firm’s
Safety Officer. The Firm’s Safety Officer is Kieran Lardner.

The Firm expects employees to recognise and undertake their responsibility to work
safely and efficiently and to adhere to the Firm’s safety rules and regulations while at
work. All employees have an obligation under the Acts to do everything they can to
prevent injury to themselves and to others. Employees also have a responsibility to report hazards or potentially hazardous situations to their manager and/or the Firm’s
Safety Officer.
