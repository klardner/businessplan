## Introductory Paragraph

The Firm wishes to provide every opportunity for every employee to express themselves
without fear of jeopardising their position. It is in everybody’s interests to establish a clear
procedure for the resolution of any issues that may arise in the workplace. Full recognition is
given to the significance of personal grievances. Disputes will be dealt with without undue
delay. You have a right to have a work colleague with you throughout the grievance meetings
if appropriate.

## Definition of a Grievance

A grievance is any event, condition, rule or practice, which you believe violates your civil
rights, treats you unfairly, or causes you any degree of unpleasantness or unhappiness on
the job. A grievance may also deal with an attitude, a statement, or an opinion held by a coworker.

## Informal Process

If you have a problem or grievance relating to any aspect of your employment with the Firm
you are encouraged to first discuss it on an informal basis with your supervising
solicitor manager. If your grievance is of a kind you feel unable to raise with your
supervising solicitor, you should raise the matter with Kieran Lardner, the Compliance Manager,
who will endeavour to deal with your grievance(s) as soon as is reasonably practicable.
However, if it cannot be dealt with informally the formal process described below will be
followed.

## Formal Process

At any stage in the formal process a Firm colleague or other appropriate representative may
accompany you.

### Step 1

Raise the grievance with your supervising solicitor, preferably in
writing, explaining that you wish to use the formal procedure. Your [supervising
solicitor/department manager] will arrange a meeting with you to discuss the matter fully with
you and listen to your concerns. You may be accompanied by a Firm colleague at this
meeting if you choose. If your grievance relates to your supervising solicitor or is of a kind you feel unable to raise with your supervising solicitor
, you should discuss the problem with a more senior manager. In many cases, the
matter will be resolved at this initial meeting.

### Step 2

If the problem is not resolved by discussion under Step 1, you may request a meeting in
writing with the next level of management. You may be accompanied by a Firm colleague at
this meeting if you choose.

The Compliance Manager will consider the information presented and you will be given an
opportunity to discuss the issue. Following the meeting, a written record will be sent to those
present for agreement. The Compliance Manager will come to a decision or make a
recommendation, possibly after consulting with appropriate members of management which
will be communicated to you.

### Step 3 – Final Step

If you are not satisfied with the decision or recommendations made at Step 2 then you may
proceed to Step 3 by notifying in writing the next level of management who has not
previously been involved in the process within 3 working days of receiving the decision or
recommendation from Step 2. Your request should set out details of the grievance and
provide any other relevant information, including the reason(s) you are dissatisfied with the
previous outcome. The [senior manager] will consider all the available information, as in Step
2, and meet with you to discuss the issue. You may be accompanied by a Firm colleague at
this meeting if you choose. The Compliance Manager will subsequently communicate his/her
decision or recommendation. Following the meeting, a written record will be sent to those
present for agreement.

The decision of this Compliance Manager is final and will be communicated without delay.
