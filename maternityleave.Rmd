## Scope

This policy is in line with the Maternity Protection Acts 1994 and 2004 and the
Adoptive Leave Acts 1995 and 2005 (the "Acts”), with the principal elements set out
below. It informs all employees covered by the Acts of their rights and entitlements
whilst in the employment of *ELHQ Solicitors* (the **“Employer”**).

The Maternity Protection Acts 1994 and 2004 (as amended) cover all female
employees regardless of their length of service or number of hours worked who
-   are pregnant;
-   have recently given birth (within 14 weeks of the birth);
-   are breastfeeding (within 26 weeks of the birth)
and who have informed their employer of their condition.

## Entitlements and conditions

-   Pregnant employees are entitled to 26 consecutive weeks’ maternity
leave of which at least two weeks must be taken before the date of birth and
at least four weeks after the date of birth. A longer period of maternity leave
may be available in circumstances where the baby was premature and such
period will be provided in the manner provided by law.

-   The employee must give the Employer at least four weeks’ written notice of
their intention to take maternity leave and also forward to the Employer a
medical certificate confirming pregnancy and specifying the expected week of
birth.

-   In the case of premature birth, the employee’s 26 weeks maternity leave
begins immediately and dates from the day of the birth.
-   The employee must give the Employer at least four weeks’ notice in writing of
her intention to return to work.
-   An employee is also entitled to take additional unpaid maternity leave of up to
16 weeks’ immediately after the end of her maternity leave.
-   The employee must inform the Employer in writing of her intention to take the
16 weeks’ additional leave not later than four weeks before the end of the 26
week maternity leave period.
-   Employees who are breastfeeding and within 26 weeks of the birth of their
child may be entitled to limited time off/breaks for breastfeeding purposes. 

## Breastfeeding Arrangements

A full-time employee who is breastfeeding will be entitled, for the period specified
below, to work breaks equivalent to one (1) hour per day for the purposes of breast
feeding in the workplace. For the purposes of the 2004 Act "breastfeeding" means
breastfeeding a child or expressing breast milk and feeding it to a child immediately
or storing it for the purposes of feeding it to a child at a later time. This entitlement
may be availed of for up to 26 weeks after the date of birth of the child. Breastfeeding
breaks may be taken as one 60 minute break, two 30 minute breaks, or three 20 
minute breaks per day as agreed with your manager. Part-time employees will be
entitled to a pro-rata benefit to that provided to full-time employees.

To avail of this benefit, the employee must inform the Employer of the intention to
avail of work breaks when advising the Employer that she will be returning to work,
i.e. not later than four weeks before the intended return to work date. The employee
should include a copy of the child’s birth certificate with such an application. Availing
of such breaks will not result in any reduction of pay for the employee.

## Father’s leave

The policy also provides time off for male employees in the event of the death of the
mother of a new born child within 40 weeks following the date of birth. If the mother
dies within 24 weeks of the birth then a father who is employed under a contract of
employment will be entitled to avail of the remainder of the 24 weeks leave as well as
additional leave.

If the mother's death is over 24 weeks after the birth, the father is entitled to leave
until 40 weeks after the birth.

## Ante/post natal medical care

All employees will be entitled to paid leave for ante-natal and post-natal care. An
employee will receive paid leave for ante-natal medical appointments before the birth
and post-natal medical appointments.

An employee must give the Employer two weeks’ written notice of any appointment
and must be able to produce a certificate that the visit took place and at what time
and date.

If an employee requires, due to urgent medical reasons, an unscheduled ante-natal
or post-natal examination, the employee must explain to the Employer, no later
than one week after the appointment, why the required notice was not given and also
must prove that the appointment was kept.

## Ante-natal classes

An employee is also entitled to paid leave to attend one set of ante-natal classes,
except for the last three classes in a set. This is a once-off entitlement. Expectant
fathers are entitled to paid time off to attend the last two ante-natal classes in a set of
classes that the expectant mother is attending. This is a once-off entitlement for
fathers in relation to one birth only. Two weeks’ notice in writing must be given to the
Employer, of the times and location of classes accompanied by an appointment card
from the relevant body running the classes.

## Miscarriage

There is no entitlement to statutory maternity leave for a miscarriage occurring up to
and including the 24th week of pregnancy. Any confinement occurring after the 24th
week, even if it does not result in a live birth, is covered.

## Social welfare maternity benefit

During maternity leave, employees who have the necessary PRSI contributions are
entitled to maternity benefit from the Department of Social Protection are
recommended to be made at least 6 weeks before the start date of maternity leave.
Claims should be made on an MB10 form (maternity benefit form), which must be
completed, signed and stamped by the employee, the employee’s doctor (not earlier
than 16 weeks before the baby is due) and by the Employer and returned to the
address on the form.

During the 16-week period of additional maternity leave no payment is made by the
Employer but an employee may be entitled to a credited social insurance contribution
for each week of unpaid leave they take (up to the maximum of 16).

## Payment by the employer during maternity leave

An employee who is on maternity leave is normally entitled to payments from the
Department of Social Protection for 26 weeks maternity leave depending on meeting
certain PRSI eligibility criteria.
Under the Maternity Protection Acts, 1994 and 2004 and the Adoptive Leave Acts,
1995 and 2005 an employer is not legally obliged to pay employees while they are on
maternity leave.

However, for all Employees with more than 6 months service, the Employer will
make up the short-fall between the Social Welfare maternity benefit and the
employee’s salary for the first 26 weeks of Maternity Leave. The Employer will not
pay the employee during any period of additional maternity leave. The employee will
sign a letter to confirm that she will return to work for the Employer after maternity
leave.

## Postponement of Leave in the Event of the Hospitalisation of the Child

If the child falls ill and is hospitalised, and the employee has availed of at least 14
weeks maternity leave, with not less than 4 of those weeks being after the week of
the birth, then she may make a request to have the remaining maternity leave, and
additional maternity leave, postponed until the child is released from hospital. The
decision to offer this postponement lies entirely at the discretion of the employer.

The employee should request this postponement in writing directly to the Employer
as soon as possible, with a letter confirming the hospitalisation of the child. The
Employer will respond in writing to requests as soon as is reasonably practicable.

Where the postponement is granted, the employee will return to work on an agreed
date. The maximum period of postponement of leave is six months from the return to
work date. The employee must provide a letter or appropriate document from the
hospital or the child’s GP confirming the date that the child was discharged from
hospital, before resuming leave. Resumed leave must be taken in one continuous
block and must commence within seven days of the child’s discharge from hospital.

## Employee absence due to sickness during period of postponement

If the employee should fall ill during a period of postponement, and subsequently is
absent from work, she will be deemed to have resumed maternity leave from the first
day of absence. If the employee prefers to avail of sick leave, she must write to the
Employer and confirm this. If an employee opts to transfer to sick leave, she forfeits
her right to any remaining leave entitlements.

## Termination of Additional Maternity Leave

Should the employee fall ill and wish to terminate additional maternity leave she may
request the Employer in writing to terminate such leave. This request may be made
during the last 4 weeks of maternity leave or during additional maternity leave. If the
Employer agrees to terminate such additional leave, the leave shall end on the date
agreed and the employee shall commence sick leave.

**IMPORTANT**: When this kind of request is made, and granted, the employee forfeits
her right to the remaining additional leave. In such circumstances, the sick leave will
be treated in the same manner as any other absence on sick leave, and normal sick
leave reporting arrangements will apply. The decision to offer this termination of
maternity leave lies entirely at the discretion of the Employer.

## Employment protection
During maternity leave and additional maternity leave, an employee will be deemed
to be in employment and her employment rights, with the exception of remuneration,
are preserved as if she were present at work. An employee who is absent on
maternity leave will be treated as if she had not been absent.

At the end of maternity leave, an employee will be entitled to return to work in the job
which the employee held immediately before the start of that period, so far as it is
reasonably practicable. However, if this is not reasonably practicable f, the employee
will be offered suitable alternative work under a new contract of employment with
terms and conditions no less favourable than those she had in her original job.

## Paternity leave

The following individuals are eligible for paternity leave of 2 weeks:

-   The father of the child
-   The spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of the mother of the child
-   The parent of a donor-conceived child

If the child in question has been adopted, individuals are eligible for paternity leave if
they are:
-   The nominated parent in the case of a married same-sex couple or
-   The spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of the adopting mother or sole male
adopter

The 2 weeks must be taken consecutively. This leave can start anytime within the
first 26 weeks following birth or adoption.

## Payment by the employer during paternity leave

An employee who is on paternity leave may qualify for Paternity Benefit from the
Department of Social Protection if they have sufficient PRSI contributions..

Under the Paternity Leave and Benefit Act 2016 and the Adoptive Leave Acts, 1995
and 2005 an employer is not legally obliged to pay employees while they are on
paternity leave. 

However, for Employees with more than 6 month's service, the Employer will
make up the short-fall between the Social Welfare maternity benefit and the
employee’s salary for the first 26 weeks of Maternity Leave. The Employer will not
pay the employee during any period of additional maternity leave. The employee will
sign a letter to confirm that she will return to work for the Employer after maternity
leave.

An employee may be entitled to 2 weeks’ Paternity Benefit, which is payable by the
State to employees who have the requisite PRSI contributions. You should contact
the Department of Social Protection to arrange to apply for Paternity Benefit.

# Adoptive leave

In the case of adoption, the adopting mothers and sole male adopters are entitled to
24 weeks’ adoptive leave from the date of placement and an additional 16 weeks’
leave at the end of this 24-week period. Notification and payment are in line with
Maternity Leave above.
